Stacks:

A stack is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first out (LIFO) principle
  - Objects can be inserted into the stack at any time, but only the most recently inserted (the "last") object can
    be removed at an time

The Stack Abstract Data Type:

push(e): Insert element e, to be the top of thestack
pop(): remove from the stack and return the top element on the stack, and error occurs if the stack is empty
size(): Return the number of elements in the stack
isEmpty(): Return a Boolean indicating if the stack is empty
top(): return the top element in the stack, without removing it; an erro occurs if the stack is empty
